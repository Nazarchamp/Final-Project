There are several things that need to happen for the website to run:

A.) I must host the website for it to work as I have google OAuth and cookies, I have hosted the website at: https://ptecfinal.web.app/ Locally it will not work on your machine.

B.) This also requires the running of a live python server to which the website will connect to, in this repository is that server, at the time of writing I have not made public an APi but soon there will be, update, I will make a public endpoint available by the end of today, until then you can run the webserver locally and use the live domain which is configured to call local host. Please note, you need to install websockets for python which can be done with: "pip install websockets"

If you have any questions about getting the website set up reach out to me

Have a good summer
