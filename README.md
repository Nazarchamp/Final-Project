There are several things that need to happen for the website to run:

A.) I must host the website for it to work as I have google OAuth and cookies, I have hosted the website at: https://ptecfinal.web.app/ Locally it will not work on your machine.

B.) This also requires the running of a live python server to which the website will connect to, in this repository is that server, at the time of writing I have not made public an APi but soon there will be

If you have any questions about getting the website set up reach out to me

Have a good summer
